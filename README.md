# CensusExaminer - Final Project in R

Throughout the Spring 2019 semester, I was introduced to R and learned many interesting aspects related to its ability to address
statistical computing problems. In particular, I enjoyed learning about its graphic interface's ability to easily depict scientific 
conclusions. To these ends, I wanted to make use of the large scale data sets provided by the US Census. 

## High level details of my Final Project

The aim of my final project was to make use of R's tidycensus package. I wanted to take a national look at a few different variables
associated with the US Census. There are many ways one can split up this analysis. While some of the functions in this package focus
on the national level, I went ahead and viewed some of these variables at the state level, partically in Florida.

### Datasets and Variables

#### As the Census data is made available to the public, it is relatively easy to source this data. For the users convenience, ~25,000
#### variables will be uploaded with the package in the file denoted as: census_variables.csv

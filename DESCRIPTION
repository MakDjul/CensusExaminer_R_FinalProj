Description: By way of tidycensus, the focus of this package is to analyze the census data through a variety of
    lenses. There are many census variables available, which can be seen in 'census_variables.csv'. At first, 
    the census variables were subject to a nation wide interpretation, accounting for state and county
    levels. In addition, due to this package developers roots in Florida, this package was aimed to further
    analyze Census variables at a lower-level.
